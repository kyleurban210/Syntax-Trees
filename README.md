I am Kyle Urban... (Online Name... Swifty Dust) I am a Linguistics Major w/ focus on Computer Science at the University of Central Arkansas. 
I worked on this project back during the summer of 2023 back when I had very limited knowledge of C++
I have since decided to upload this program as I was it to act as a cornerstone on my resume
I am not proud of this program, it was simply a learning experience.
I implemented a lot of recursion into this program before I knew what that was, so there are many recursive functions that lack a base case/never reach a base case
I also hadn't learned OOP yet, so unfortunetaly all my code is written in one file like a noob

The intent of this program was to allow the user to enter a sentence, and then that setence's words would be parsed and tokenized
based upon their syntatic classes... 

This program was intended to be a step toward making a program that could diagram Syntax Trees. 



Anyways... if you wanna actually see me messing around with this program.... my Youtube Channel is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXu6w3sODo0
